Mana
- Mana is mental energy/thought
- Mana can be generated by:
  = natural growth of amethyst crystals
  = lightning?
  = XP?
  = organics -> corpses, shrubs? (anything edible + anything compostable?)
- Mana generation turns amethyst into perfect crystals, recharges batteries

Amethyst
- Amethyst stores mana
- Amethyst comes in dust, crystals, perfect crystals
- Each type is worth X mana; must consume an entire item; use up mana producing items least->greatest
- Later-game create rechargeable mana batteries?

Wandless Spellcasting
- do away with trinkets
- cyphers start with X mana crystals inside and cannot replace them
- artifacts can replace the mana crystals inside as they break
- these are special in that they can partially consume crystals

Per-world patterns
- all spells are like this?
- only great spells are like this?
- find the patterns on scrolls in chests

CastException
- Tiers of spell mishaps:
  = puff of smoke, drop your wand
  = consume a lot of mana, drop all your items
  = just kill you, something apt for a great spell
- Mishap based on the type of exception
- item that gives you more detail on the precise manner of the exception

Great Spells
- require some kind of answer to a question to cast successfully
  (see young wizards calculating oxygen amounts to teleport to the moon)
- https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Epic_Spells_and_Powers
- greater teleport:
  = total items in inventory? (see chronometer fablehaven not taking your clothes with you)
  = some irritating math question about the specific vector involved?
  = review eragon's teleportation spell, D&D teleport, oathgates
- flight
  = you must be on the ground within X seconds or you take infinite fall damage
- quarry region
- power word kill

Great Work
- Way to generate infinite mana
  = recharge wands/batteries upon touching them?
- borrow from FMA and require the death of 100+ entities at once? (And if not, it gets the caster?)
- nigredo albedo citrinas rubedo?
  > Nigredo is the dissolution of the false self; the burning of the old to ashes
  > Albedo is the "raising" of the remains to the heavenly sphere in gaseous form; take the ashes and make them reborn
  > Citrinas is an optional step but it boils down to some form of "aging" or "wisdom" (which comes with age);
    take the newborn (true) self and temper it with time and/or knowledge
  > Rubedo is the final distillation; you take the results from albedo/citrinas and you compress them down to a usable
    form, the stone
  -- alwinfy
- instructions in the form of an emerald-tablet-esque riddle
  = include one line on each spell scroll
  = assemble the poem, crack the riddle, &c
- possible workflow:
  = Cast the first half of the spell, requiring an enumeration of your sins:
    + numbers of villagers killed?
    + number of passives killed?
    + total damage dealt?
    You must have no items and no XP (caveat for keepInventory players: under 1 level of XP)
  = Timer starts (Witness-esque music track?)
  = Nigredo: endure 10 seconds of Wither and 10 seconds of constant fire without picking up any items.
  = Albedo:
    + teleport 64 blocks in the air and survive the fall?
    + gain levitation for X seconds; by the time you hit the floor you must have done Y?
    + cure a zombie villager?
  = Citrinitas:
    + Fight a bunch of mobs?
    + Must have 30+ XP levels to cast the second half?
  = Cast the second half of the spell, requiring an enumeration of your accomplishments:
    + diamonds mined?
    + raids won?
    + spells cast?
    + undead slain?
  = Rubedo: Attain the Great Work.
