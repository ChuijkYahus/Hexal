# Hexal

A minecraft mod which is an addon for [Hex Casting](https://github.com/gamma-delta/HexMod/), adding new patterns (as well as whatever else I feel like).

If you want to fork this and play around with it, you'll need to create blank `changelog.md` and `keys.properties` files in the root project directory.

## Branches

* `main`: Active development for Minecraft 1.20.1.
* `1.19.2`: Long-term support for Minecraft 1.19.2.
* `1.18.2`: Long-term support for Minecraft 1.18.2.
* `main_old`: Legacy `main` branch from when there was both a `main` and `1.20.1` branch with new commits on both. This will be deleted at some point.
