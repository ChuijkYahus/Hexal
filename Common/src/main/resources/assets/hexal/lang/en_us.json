  "hexal.page.hexal_basics.remaining_evals": "Adds the number of evaluations a hex is still capable of to the stack. This is reduced by $(l:patterns/meta#hexcasting:eval)$(action)Hermes' Gambit/$ and $(l:patterns/meta#hexcasting:for_each)$(action)Thoth's Gambit/$.",

  "hexal.page.wisps.0": "I have discovered a way to create constructs from the media itself, visible to others and able to move and act somewhat on their own. They are able to cast hexes in my place, similar to how a $(l:patterns/meta#hexcasting:eval)$(action)Hermes' Gambit/$ evaluates patterns. They do take some of my attention to operate this however, and if too many try and execute at once I will only be able to run some of them, leaving the rest for the next instant.",
  "hexal.page.wisps.1": "When they are created I assign them a 'reservoir' of media that they have access to, which is taken from me and used to form the wisp. A wisp uses up part of its reservoir simply existing, and when it evaluates the pattern list it is carrying any costs incurred are removed from its reservoir. All wisps seem to take three $(l:items/amethyst)$(item)Amethyst Dust/$ to summon, in addition to whatever media is used for their reservoir.",
  "hexal.page.wisps.wisp/summon/projectile.0": "This wisp is summoned and launched like an arrow, casting its hex on whatever it hits. The initial stack when it executes will be a reference to itself, then a reference to what it hit.",
  "hexal.page.wisps.wisp/summon/projectile.1": "This could be a block position or an entity reference. The first vector accepted is the location the wisp will be summoned, while the direction of the second is the direction the wisp will be launched, and the second's magnitude seems to affect the wisp's velocity. The cost of the spell increases with the squared magnitude. The number accepted determines the wisp's reservoir in $(l:items/amethyst)$(item)Amethyst Dust/$. It loses one $(l:items/amethyst)$(item)Amethyst Dust/$ of media every second once summoned, and has a range of influence of 4 blocks.",
  "hexal.page.wisps.wisp/summon/ticking.0": "Similar to Summon Projectile Wisp, but with only one vector input for the position to summon the wisp. Cyclic wisps are unmoving once summoned, instead executing their hex up to 20 times each second.",
  "hexal.page.wisps.wisp/summon/ticking.1": "The first time it casts the stack will start with a reference to itself, from which point it will always start with the stack and ravenmind in the state they finished on the last cast. This wisp has a less stable form making it lose significantly more media every second, losing one $(l:items/amethyst)$(item)Amethyst Dust/$ per second once summoned, as well as an amount proportional to the amount remaining. It has a range of influence of 8 blocks.",
  "hexal.page.wisps.wisp/media": "Add the amount of media in the wisp's reservoir to the stack. This must be cast by a wisp; trying to cast it through a staff will fail rather spectacularly.",

There are a number of patterns related to creating these links that are able to transmit information, and a number of patterns related to sending and receiving iotas over a link once it is created. A wisp can have any number of links active, with each costing a negligible amount of media to maintain each twentieth of a second.",
  "hexal.page.links.1": "As links are created connected to a wisp that wisp will assign an order to them, based on the order which they were created, which is used to reference the links in a number of patterns. Unless otherwise stated, these patterns must be evaluated by a wisp, with unpleasant consequences if I try to evaluate them myself.",

  "hexal.page.links.link/comm/send": "Removes an iota from the stack, then removes an index from the stack and sends the iota along the link at the given index.  This costs one hundredth of an $(l:items/amethyst)$(item)Amethyst Dust/$.",

  "hexal.page.great_wisps.wisp/consume.1": "Costs either an $(l:items/amethyst)$(item)Amethyst Crystal/$ if the wisp is owned by you, or half again as much media as the consumed wisp contains if the wisp is owned by another. Repurposing the media is not completely efficient, losing one twentieth of the consumed wisp's reserve in transfer.",
