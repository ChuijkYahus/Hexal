  "hexal.page.wisps.0": "I have discovered a way to create constructs from the media itself, visible to others and able to move and act somewhat on their own. They are able to cast hexes in my place, similar to how a $(l:patterns/meta#hexcasting:eval)$(action)Hermes' Gambit/$ evaluates patterns. They do take some of my attention to operate this however, and if too many try and execute at once I will only be able to run some of them, leaving the rest for the next instant.",
  "hexal.page.wisps.1": "When they are created I assign them a 'reservoir' of media that they have access to, which is taken from me and used to form the wisp. A wisp uses up part of its reservoir simply existing, and when it evaluates the pattern list it is carrying any costs incurred are removed from its reservoir. All wisps seem to take one $(l:items/amethyst)$(item)Amethyst Shard/$ to summon, in addition to whatever media is used for their reservoir.",

The first vector accepted is the location the wisp will be summoned, while the direction of the second is the direction the wisp will be launched, and the second's magnitude seems to affect the wisp's velocity. The cost of the spell increases with the squared magnitude. The number accepted determines the wisp's reservoir in $(l:items/amethyst)$(item)Amethyst Dust/$. It loses one $(l:items/amethyst)$(item)Amethyst Shard/$ of media every second once summoned, and has a range of influence of 4 blocks.",

This wisp has a less stable form making it lose significantly more media every second, losing one $(l:items/amethyst)$(item)Amethyst Shard/$ per second once summoned, as well as an amount proportional to the amount remaining. It has a range of influence of 8 blocks.",
